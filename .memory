# Mochi Chat Extension Requirements

## General Guidelines
1. Debug logs should be in background script console with module identifiers [Mochi-Background], [Mochi-Content], etc.
2. Use dynamic imports with chrome.runtime.getURL instead of static imports
3. Include detailed comments for code sections and function parameters
4. Be cautious about removing code - it may be in use or needed for future
5. Keep this memory file updated with new requirements
6. Review memory file before making changes to check for conflicts
7. Document resolved issues in Tips section

## Current Features
- Text extraction from PDFs and websites
- Chat interface with toggle functionality
- Message history management
- Background script for extension-wide functionality
- Error handling and logging

## Tips for Myself
1. Be careful when removing exports from modules - check for dependencies first. Example: getHistory() in conversation.js is used by chat.js for conversation state management.
